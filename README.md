## Description

Repository for the backend of the project hunt website.

## What is Project Hunt?

It is a place for people to showcase their projects and discover projects by peers. Unlike a website like Product Hunt for example, the focus is not on how unique or how viable (business wise) the product is, but on how well the project is made as far as technicalities and design goes.

A growing segment of the developer/designer/product market is looking for people with past projects having been made. A portfolio site where projects can be showcased, and also where great projects can be discovered can help foster this community.

[Arnav Bhaiiya] (https://github.com/championswimmer) at coding blocks is helping us, and documenting the development in open
